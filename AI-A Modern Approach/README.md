# Notes for *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach*

## 1. Introduction

### Definition of AI

Four kinds definition of AI

|                  |                    |
|------------------|--------------------|
| Thinking Humanly | Thinking Rationally |
| Acting Humanly   | Acting Rationally   |

1. Acting Humanly

    Turing Test, with following six disciplines

    * natural language processing

    * knowledge representation

    * automated reasoning

    * machine learning

    * computer vision

    * robotics

1. Thinking Humanly

    Cognitive modeling / cognitive science

    Three ways to get inside the actual working of human minds:

    * through introspection

    * through psychological experiments

    * through brain imaging

1. Thinking rationally

    Laws of thought / logic

    Two main obstacles to solve any solvable problem described in logical notation:

    * hard to state knowledge in formal terms

    * solving in practice is much harder than solving in principle

1. Acting rationally

    **Rational agent** is expected to:

    * operate autonomously

    * perceive their environment

    * persist over a prolonged time period

    * adapt to change

    * create and pursue goals

    Two advantages of rational agent:

    * More general than the "law of thought" approach / Thinking rationally

    * More amenable than approaches based on human thought or human behavior

    **This book concentrates on *rational agents*.**

### The Foundations of artificial Intelligence

1. Philosophy

    * Can formal rules be used to draw valid conclusions?

        Syllogisms, Calculating machine, Pascaline, Artificial animal

    * How does the mind arise from a physical brain?

        * rationalism

            Aristotle, Leibnitz

        * dualism

            Descartes

        * materialism

    * Where does knowledge come from?

        empiricism, logical positivism, confirmation theory, observation sentences, induction

    * How does knowledge lead to action?

        **Actions are justified by a logical connection between goals and knowledge of the action’s outcome. (By Aristotle)**

        Newell and Simon's GPS

        Antoine Arnauld's quantitative formula

        John Stuart Mill’s rational decision criteria

1. Mathematics

    AI become a formal science need mathematical formalization in:

    * logic - What are the formal rules to draw valid conclusions?

        propositional logic/Boolean logic

        first-order logic

    * computation - What can be computed?

        * algorithm

            Euclid's algorithm for computing greatest common divisors

            logical deduction

            incompleteness theorem,

        * tractability

            NP-completeness

    * probability - How do we reason with uncertain information?

        uncertain measurements

        incomplete theories

        Bayes’ rule

1. Economics

    * How should we make decisions so as to maximize payoff?

        preferred outcomes/utility

    * How should we do this when others may not go along?

        Decision theory

    * How should we do this when the payoff may be far in the future?
