1. How to determine a certain state of 8-puzzle is reachable from another state quickly? In another word, find a function takes an state as parameter and returns a value to indicate the state class. The states of the same class are reachable to each other. How about 15-puzzle, 24-puzzle, etc. ?

1. Prove that a heuristic function which is admissible or/and consistent is optimal.
